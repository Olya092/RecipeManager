<!--TODO: this would be a "community page" , avalable for all users 
(doesn't metter logged in users, or just a visitor). 
Basically a clone of current AdminView page, but anyone could see it and make changes (add, delete, update recipes).
Socket.io could be used here to update the page in real-time, so all users could see the changes immediately
